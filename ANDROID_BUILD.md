# Building the Family Activity Tracker Android App

## Overview
The Family Activity Tracker has been successfully converted to a native Android app using Capacitor. This provides reliable notifications and better user experience compared to the web version.

## Prerequisites

To build the Android app, you need:

1. **Android Studio 2024.2.1+** - [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. **Java Development Kit (JDK 17+)** - Included with Android Studio
3. **Android SDK** - Installed via Android Studio SDK Manager
4. **Node.js 20+** - Already installed in this project

## Build Process

### 1. Build the Web App
```bash
npm run build
```
This creates optimized web assets in `dist/public/`

### 2. Sync with Android
```bash
npx cap sync android
```
This copies the web assets to the Android project and updates plugins

### 3. Open in Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```
This opens the native Android project in Android Studio

### 4. Build APK in Android Studio

1. **Connect your Android device** or start an emulator
2. **Configure signing** (for release builds):
   - Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK
   - Create a new keystore or use existing
3. **Build the app**:
   - For testing: Build → Make Project
   - For release: Build → Generate Signed Bundle/APK

## Key Features of the Native App

### ✅ Native Android Notifications
- **Reliable delivery** - No more web notification issues
- **Daily reminders** - Automatic 8 PM Pacific notifications
- **Permission management** - Proper Android notification permissions
- **Custom branding** - "FamilyTracker" branding on notifications

```

## Development Workflow

### Live Development with Device Testing
1. **Find your local IP**: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (Mac)
2. **Update capacitor.config.ts**:
   ```typescript
   server: {
     url: 'http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:5000',
     cleartext: true
   }
   ```
3. **Build and sync**: `npm run build && npx cap sync android`
4. **Run on device** - Changes to web code will live-reload

### Production Build Process
1. **Remove development server** from `capacitor.config.ts`
2. **Build optimized version**: `npm run build`
3. **Sync to Android**: `npx cap sync android`
4. **Generate signed APK** in Android Studio

## Installation & Distribution

### For Testing
- **Direct APK install** - Build debug APK and install via USB/ADB
- **Google Play Console** - Upload to internal testing track

### For Production
- **Google Play Store** - Upload signed AAB (Android App Bundle)
- **Direct distribution** - Share APK file directly with family

## Native Notification Setup

The app includes a **Native Notification Admin** panel available to Vlad and in family view:

1. **Permission Request** - App requests notification permissions on first launch
2. **Test Notifications** - Button to test notification functionality
3. **Schedule Daily Reminders** - Set up 8 PM Pacific time reminders
4. **Status Monitoring** - View permission status and active schedules

## Next Steps

1. **Test on Android device** - Install and verify all features work
2. **Configure notification timing** - Adjust reminder schedule if needed  
3. **Deploy to family** - Distribute APK or publish to Play Store
4. **Monitor usage** - Check if notifications improve activity logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build errors**: Ensure Android Studio is updated and SDK is properly installed
- **Notification not working**: Check device notification permissions in Settings
- **App crashes**: Check Android Studio logcat for error details
- **Live reload not working**: Verify local IP and firewall settings
