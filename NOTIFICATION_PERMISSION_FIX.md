# Fix Android Notification Permissions

## What I Fixed

✅ **Added Android Notification Permissions** to AndroidManifest.xml:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - Required for Android 13+ notification posting
- `WAKE_LOCK` - Allows notifications to wake the device  
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Ensures notifications persist after reboot

✅ **Improved Permission Detection** in the app:
- Now checks both `display` and `alert` permission types
- Added better logging to see permission status
- Added "Recheck Permissions" button to refresh after Android settings changes

✅ **Enhanced Notification Admin Panel**:
- Shows "Recheck Permissions" button when permissions are denied
- Better feedback when permissions are granted/denied
- Clear instructions for users

## How to Update Your Android App

### Step 1: Download Latest Code
Since you already have the project, pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
npm install
```

### Step 2: Rebuild the App
```bash
npm run build
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
```

### Step 3: Rebuild APK in Android Studio
1. In Android Studio, click **Build** → **Clean Project**
2. Then **Build** → **Generate Signed Bundle/APK** → **APK**
3. Build and install the new APK on your phone

### Step 4: Fix Permissions on Your Phone

**Method 1: Through the App**
1. Open the updated Family Activity Tracker app
2. If you see "Notification Permission: Denied", tap **"Recheck Permissions"**
3. When Android asks for notification permission, tap **"Allow"**

**Method 2: Through Android Settings**
1. Go to Settings → Apps → Family Activity Tracker
2. Tap **Notifications** → Enable **"Allow notifications"**
3. Return to the app and tap **"Recheck Permissions"**

**Method 3: Complete Reset (if needed)**
1. Uninstall the old app completely
2. Install the new APK
3. Grant notification permission when first prompted

## Testing the Fix

Once you rebuild and reinstall:

1. **Check Permission Status**: Should show "Granted" instead of "Denied"
2. **Test Notification**: Tap "Send Test Notification" - you should see a notification
3. **Schedule Reminders**: Tap "Schedule 8 PM Reminder" to enable daily notifications

## Troubleshooting

**Still shows "Denied"?**
- Make sure you installed the NEW APK with the updated permissions
- Check Android Settings → Apps → Family Activity Tracker → Notifications
- Try uninstalling and reinstalling the app completely

**Notifications don't appear?**
- Check if "Do Not Disturb" mode is enabled
- Verify notification settings for the app in Android settings
- Try rebooting your phone after enabling permissions

Your notification system will work perfectly once you rebuild with these permission fixes!
