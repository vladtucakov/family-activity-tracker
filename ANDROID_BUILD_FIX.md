# Android Build Fix - Duplicate Resource Resolved

## ✅ Issue Fixed!

The Android build error was caused by duplicate `ic_launcher_background` resource definitions:
- One in `colors.xml` (our custom branding)
- One in auto-generated `ic_launcher_background.xml` (Capacitor default)

## What I Fixed

✅ **Removed duplicate file** - Deleted `android/app/src/main/res/values/ic_launcher_background.xml`  
✅ **Kept branded version** - Our Family Activity Tracker blue (#2563EB) in colors.xml  
✅ **Synced changes** - Updated Android project with fix

## Try Building Again

Now your Android build should work:

```bash
# In your project folder:
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android

# In Android Studio:
gradlew clean
gradlew assembleDebug
```

## What This Fixes

- ✅ **Build Process** - No more duplicate resource errors
- ✅ **Icon Background** - Uses Family Activity Tracker blue (#2563EB)
- ✅ **Clean Build** - Ready for APK generation

## Next Steps for Full Branding

The build will now work, but for complete Family Activity Tracker branding you still need to:

1. **Replace icon PNG files** with custom Family Activity Tracker designs
2. **Rebuild and install** the updated APK
3. **Test branding** appears on home screen

The duplicate resource conflict is resolved - your Android build should succeed now!
