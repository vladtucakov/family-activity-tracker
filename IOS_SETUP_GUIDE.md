# Family Activity Tracker - iOS App Setup

## Overview

I'm setting up your Family Activity Tracker for iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) using the same Capacitor framework that powers your Android app. This will give your family a native iOS app with proper notifications and offline capabilities.

## What I'm Setting Up

✅ **iOS Platform Integration** - Adding Capacitor iOS support to your project  
✅ **Native iOS Notifications** - LocalNotifications plugin for iPhone notifications  
✅ **Server Connection** - Configured to connect to your Replit server  
✅ **Brand Configuration** - Family Activity Tracker branding for iOS  
✅ **Notification Permissions** - Proper iOS notification permission handling

## iOS App Features

Your iOS app will have the same functionality as Android:
- **Native Notifications** - Daily 8 PM Pacific reminders
- **Family Activity Tracking** - All 6 categories (household, health, creative, learning, helping, play)
- **Streak Tracking** - Maintain activity streaks across family members
- **Real-time Sync** - Data syncs with your Replit server
- **Offline Support** - Works when internet is spotty

## Build Requirements

To build the iOS app, you'll need:
- **Mac Computer** - Required for iOS development
- **Xcode** - Apple's development environment (free from App Store)
- **Apple Developer Account** - Free for testing, $99/year for App Store distribution

## Build Process

Once setup is complete:

```bash
# Build the web app
npm run build

# Sync with iOS
npx cap sync ios

# Open in Xcode
npx cap open ios
```

In Xcode:
1. **Select Device** - Choose your iPhone or iOS Simulator
2. **Build & Run** - Click the play button to install on device
3. **Grant Permissions** - Allow notifications when prompted

## iOS-Specific Configuration

The iOS app includes:
- **Info.plist** - iOS app metadata and permissions
- **Notification Entitlements** - Permission to send notifications
- **App Icons** - iOS-specific icon sizes and formats
- **Launch Screen** - Branded splash screen
- **Privacy Descriptions** - Explains why app needs notification permissions

## Distribution Options

**TestFlight (Recommended for Family)**
- Share with up to 100 family/friends
- Easy installation via TestFlight app
- Automatic updates when you release new versions

**App Store**
- Public distribution
- Requires Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- Apple review process (typically 1-2 days)

**Direct Install (Development)**
- Install directly from Xcode to your devices
- Free but limited to your personal devices
- Certificates expire after 1 week (free accounts) or 1 year (paid)

## Family Installation

Once built, your family can install via:
1. **TestFlight invite links** (easiest for family sharing)
2. **Direct Xcode installation** (if you have their devices)
3. **App Store download** (if you publish publicly)

Your Family Activity Tracker will work perfectly on all iOS devices with the same reliable notification system and data synchronization you have on Android!
